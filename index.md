# Education
Academic Degrees
2014-2018 National Polytechnic Institute, Mexico City.
Title of the Thesis “Facial Expression Recognition”
Ph.D. on Communications and Electronics (Honorific Mention). Advisor Ph.D. Hector Manuel Perez
Meana. During the Doctorate, an algorithm to automatically extract the interest regions of face and
a classifier based on clustering techniques and fuzzy logic were developed.
2011-2013 National Polytechnic Institute, Mexico City.
Title of the Thesis: "Optimization and Application of Unsupervised Learning Algorithms."
Master in Microelectronics Engineering. Advisors Ph.D. Hector Manuel Perez Meana and PhD.
Enrique Escamilla Hernandez. During the Master's Program, an unsupervised learning algorithm was
developed for robotic applications, learning an image through the Internet. It was also tested in
recognition of environmental sounds, surpassing the results obtained by an Artificial Neural
Network and equaling the results of a vector support machine.
2006 - 2011 Autonomous Metropolitan University, Mexico City.
Electronic Engineer
# Research stays
